# Repository for Agara Bio Workshop 
## Hidden Markov Models 
## Part 1: December 6, 2020 
## Part 2: February 7, 2021


Welcome to our tutorial for developing and using a hidden Markov model (HMM)! Here, you'll find... 
- The slides explaining a theory of HMMs, probability, the Markov assumption, and the major algorithms (HMM_week2.pdf) 
- A basic guide to python that reviews the skills and data structures used (Intro_to_Python_Full.ipynb)
- A notebook to build your HMM either on your own (HMM_Building) or with the details filled in (HMM_Building_Key)
- The raw training data you'll need to read in (HMM_DNA_training.npy and HMM_State_training.npy)
- The counts returned by your model... which you can read in mid-way if your function is taking a while to run (emission_counts.npy, start_counts.npy, transition_counts.npy)
